# Key Features

tAhIni is built to solve the mess that modern digital assessments have turned into. Instructors are overloaded, grading takes too long, and the rise of AI-generated answers has completely reshaped the trust dynamics around online exams. tAhIni tackles these issues with a set of tightly engineered features designed for clarity, control, and real-world practicality.

## 1. Smart, Structured Grading Workflow

Grading shouldn’t feel like punishment.

No two courses assess knowledge the same way.
tAhIni supports a wide range of exam types so instructors aren’t boxed into rigid formats:
<ul>
<li>Multiple-choice</li>
<li>Structured/short answers</li>

<li>File-upload submissions</li>

<li>A unified inbox for all submissions</li>
<li>Automatic formatting and file checks</li>
<li>Version comparison for re-uploads</li>

</ul>

Everything stays clean, organized and recoverable.

## 6. Precision Access Control

Institutions can define exactly who can do what:
<ul>
<li>Admins</li>

<li>Teaching assistants</li>
<li>External markers</li>
<li>Students</li>
</ul>

Fine-grained permissions, simple management.

## 7. Actionable Analytics

Data isn’t useful unless it tells a story.

<li>Question difficulty rankings</li>
<li>Score distributions</li>
<li>Cohort comparisons</li>
<li>Trend lines across semesters</li>
<li>Integrity-related event flags</li>
</ul>

It’s analytics built for educators, not statisticians.
