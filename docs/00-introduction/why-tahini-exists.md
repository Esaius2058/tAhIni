# Why tAhIni Exists

tAhIni was born out of a simple observation: digital assessment tools have expanded quickly, but the realities of grading, exam integrity, and instructor workload haven’t kept up.

Most institutions have adopted online assessments, but the actual experience for instructors and students is still painfully inefficient. Instructors spend hours manually grading scripts, dealing with messy submissions, and chasing down inconsistencies. Meanwhile, the sudden rise of AI-assisted cheating has forced instructors to pull back from online tests altogether because existing platforms don't give them the confidence or control they need. It's like the software crisis from the 1950s but for exams and integrity.

tAhIni exists to fix that gap, not by reinventing the exam, but by reinventing the entire process around it.

## The Real Problems We’re Solving
<ul>
<li>Slow, exhausting grading workflows
Instructors routinely spend days marking large classes. Even “digital” exams still require manual work that drains time and energy. tAhIni streamlines grading with structured submissions, automated workflows, and optional AI-assisted marking where instructors stay fully in control.
</li>

<li>Fear of AI-generated answers
Tools like ChatGPT have made it incredibly easy for students to cheat quietly. This has pushed instructors to avoid online assessments or rely on outdated monitoring tools that don’t actually solve the problem. tAhIni introduces exam formats and verification mechanisms that make AI-cheating significantly harder while still keeping exams accessible and fair.
</li>

<li>Fragmented exam management
Many current systems handle exam creation one way, grading another way, integrity checks somewhere else, and analytics as an afterthought. tAhIni brings everything into one tightly integrated workflow designed specifically for high-stakes assessments.

## Our Vision

tAhIni exists to give instructors a platform that finally works with them instead of against them; speeding up grading, reducing administrative chaos, and restoring trust in digital assessments. And for institutions, it provides consistency, security, and transparency in a world where exam integrity is becoming a moving target.

tAhIni’s mission is simple:
### Make online examinations faster to manage, easier to grade, and far more secure.
